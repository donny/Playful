/* Question:
 One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character and replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
 Example:
 pale, ple -> true
 pales, pale -> true
 pale, bale -> true
 pale, bake -> false
